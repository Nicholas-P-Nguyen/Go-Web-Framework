Any collaborations on this assignment with tools/people outside your group? (If you received significant help on the assignment from another student, e.g. copied code, then if you disclose it here, your grade for this assignment will be a zero, but there will be no referral to the university level discipline committee):
No, I did not use any materials outside the course materials, Go documentation, and this YouTube video to learn about the net/http package.
